Package-manager independent suite of tools used to install, remove,
and configure binary packages. Using an XML configuration file to
describe the package, the pkgutils suite automatically downloads and
installs packages including all necessary dependencies, provides
information on the list of installed packages, removes packages,
configures packages (runs the package pre-remove and post-install
scripts), and queries a repository for a list of updated packages.

The TLS protocol, and the SSL protocol 3.0 and possibly earlier, does
not properly associate renegotiation handshakes with an existing
connection, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert data
into HTTPS sessions, and possibly other types of sessions protected by
TLS or SSL, by sending an unauthenticated request that is processed
retroactively by a server in a post-renegotiation context, related to
a "plaintext injection" attack, aka the "Project Mogul"
issue.</para></item>

Memory leak in the <command>zlib_stateful_finish</command> function in
<command>crypto/comp/c_zlib.c</command> allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via vectors that
trigger incorrect calls to the
<command>CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data</command> function, as
demonstrated by use of SSLv3 and PHP with the Apache HTTP Server, a
related issue to <command>CVE-2008-1678</command>.</para></item>
