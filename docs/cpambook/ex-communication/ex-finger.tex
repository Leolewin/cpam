From the Debian package description:
\begin{quote}
Fingerd is a simple daemon based on RFC 1196 \cite{RFC1196} that provides an interface to the
``finger'' program at most network sites.  The program is supposed to return a
friendly, human-oriented status report on either the system at the moment or a
particular person in depth.
