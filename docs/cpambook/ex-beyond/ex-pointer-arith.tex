\begin{Exercise}[title={Pointer arithmetic},difficulty=4]
\label{ex:pointer arithmetic}
\Question
In the main text on page \pageref{main:pointer arithmetic}
there is the following text:

\begin{quote}
\ldots there is no pointer arithmetic, so if you write:
\lstinline{*p++}, it is interpreted as \lstinline{(*p)++}: first
dereference and then increment the value.
\end{quote}
When you increment a value like this, for which types will it work?
\Question Why doesn't it work for all types?

\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
\Question This will only work for pointers to point to numerical (\type{int, uint}, etc) values.
\Question The \func{++} is only defined for numerical types and because there
is no operator overloading in Go it fails (compilation error) otherwise.
\end{Answer}
