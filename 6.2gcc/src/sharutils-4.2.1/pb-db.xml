      <description>
This is the set of GNU shar utilities.

`shar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
them for transmission by electronic mail services. `unshar' helps
unpacking shell archives after reception.

`uuencode' prepares a file for transmission over an electronic channel
which ignores or otherwise mangles the eight bit (high order bit) of
bytes. `uudecode' does the converse transformation. They are derived
from the BSD NET/2 distribution, but enchanced with the features
described in recent POSIX standards.

`remsync' allows for remote synchronization of directory trees, using
electronic mail. This part of sharutils is still alpha.
