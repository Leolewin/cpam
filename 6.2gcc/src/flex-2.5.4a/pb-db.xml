Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized
lexical patterns in text. flex reads the given input files for a
description of a scanner to generate. The description is in the form
of pairs of regular expressions and C code, called rules. flex
generates as output a C source file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine
yylex(). This file is compiled and linked with the -lfl library to
produce an executable. When the executable is run, it analyzes its
input for occurrences of the regular expressions. Whenever it finds
one, it executes the corresponding C code.
