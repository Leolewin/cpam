I managed to get ahold of a copy of gaim that has a custom RVP protocol
implementation written that does work with Motorola's IM servers. I'm
guessing Bell Labs is also stuck with the same IM infrastructure as we are.

Before everyone gets too excited, it is a bit of a pain to get compiled
and working, as it only works with gaim version 0.59.8 that it was
packaged with. I've compiled it on two different computers, one worked,
one didn't.

If anyone has some time to take a look at the code and can get it working
under the latest version of gaim, I would be eternally grateful. :)

The code is at:
ftp://linux-depot.mot.com/pub/misc/gaimsrc.tar.gz

and the protocol is in src/src/protocols/rvp.
