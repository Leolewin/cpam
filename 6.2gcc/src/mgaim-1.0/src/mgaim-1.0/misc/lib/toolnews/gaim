RVP account screen now allows a fixed port to be used for incoming
connections.   Most people will leave this blank (or use the
default "NA"), but this may be useful when running behind a 
firewall.

Fixed a bug which was causing some users to be able to send messages, but
not receive them.

04/07/04
========
RVP module now has better support for non-English unicode characters
(accents, umlauts, etc.) Previously, attempting to send these characters
would cause the client to disconnect.

========
Bug fixes in RVP module.  Added an "Auth ID" field to the RVP account
setup screen.  Some sites use an authentication id which is different
from the screenname used for messaging.   It can be left blank if the
authorization id is the same as the screen name.

Gaim now includes some Lucent specific changes which provide support
for the RVP protocol used by Microsoft Exchanged Instant Messenger (the
instant messaging software used by many PC users with Lucent).   Please 
note that this software is supported on an "as able" basis.  If you find 
problems (a very real possibiltity) there are no guarantees about how 
quickly they will be fixed, or even if they will be fixed at all.  
However, many people have found the RVP plugin to be quite useful, so
we're making it available to get feedback and find/fix problems.  

Report problems to exptools@lucent.com or to the provider.

Basic instructions for accessing Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging 
from UNIX workstations:

- The client is /opt/exp/bin/gaim.   Make sure you are invoking this with
  a full path (or "where gaim" gives this path) to ensure that you are 
  running the version with RVP support.  (RVP is the network protocol used
  between the client and the Exchange Server)

- When gaim is started, the initial has the gaim logo, and buttons labelled:
  "Quit," "Accounts," "Signon," etc.  Click "Accounts" to bring up the
  account editor.  

- From the Account Editor, click the icon labelled "Add"

- From the add account dialog,  set the following items:

	Protocol:  RVP (do this first)
	Screenname:   xxxxx (enter your lucent handle without @lucent.com)
	Password:           (leave this blank)
	Alias:  (enter an alias for your self - this is recommended)
	Remember Password:   (uncheck this)
	Auth Host: im.lucent.com (keep the default)
	Auth Domain:  xxx (default value is "na02", but you need to change 
		it if your are in another domain)
	Auto Login:  (your choice)

  You should not tell gaim to remember your password.   First, domain 
  passwords are changed at least once a month, and this can cause confusion 
  for  gaim.  Second, your password be stored in plaintext in your 
  $HOME/.gaimrc file, so this can be a security risk.

- Click OK to add the account.

- By default, gaim is configured to not use a proxy server.  This is the
  setting needed for RVP, so new users should not have to worry about 
  disabling proxies.  However, if you've used gaim in the past, you may
  have a proxy enabled.  You must disable it by selecting "Options" from the
  welcome screen, the selecting "Proxy"

- There are several ways to get logged in

	1) From the Account Editor, click on the account and then 
	   clock "Sign On/Off"

	2) Close the Account Aditor and click "Signon" from the welcome
	   screen.

	3) If  "Auto Login" is enable for the account, gaim will automatically
	   attempt to login when the program is started.

- Whatever method is used, once you've successfully logged in to the server,
  the window will change to the buddy status window which "Online" and 
 "Edit Buddies" tabs.  Use the "Edit Buddies" tab to see a list of all
  buddies, and to add new ones.  Most typically, the "Online" tab is 
  selected - it shows only your on-line buddies and allows you to send 
  them a message by double clicking on their name.

- To add a buddy, select the "Edit Buddies" tab, then the "Add" icon at
  the bottom.   In the Add Buddy dialog, enter:

	Contact:  yyyyy   (Enter the lucent handle without @lucent.com)
	Alias:  zzzzzz    (Your choice, but it is recommended to supply one)

  It's best to always use an alias for each contact.  The alias can be
  the persons' full name, a nickname of your choice, or the same as
  the Lucent handle.  When a message is received from that person, it
  will be displayed using the alias.   If you don't supply an alias, 
  messages will be displayed using the rather lengthy hostname of the
  Exchange server.

- To send a message you need to add the remote user to your contact
  list, then double-click on their name.  (Or right-click and select "IM")
  In theory, you should also be able to send a message to them by
  selecting the "Send Instant Message" icon from the lower left.  But
  that's a bug right now, and only works if the person is in your contact
  list

Upgraded gaim-0.59.8.  This is mostly just bugfixes to the earlier
releases - not much change in functionality.   Support for the 
public MSN server (e.g. hotmail.com) is still broken in this release - 
we're hoping to provide that along with a new version of gaim in the
future.

05/22/02
========
Upgraded to gaim-0.58.  This version offers bug fixes and improved jabber
support (for example, it can register new jabber ids on the server)

03/28/01
========

Upgrade to gaim-0.11.0pre9. 

version 0.11.0-pre9 (03/26/2001):
	* Can register Jabber accounts (load the Jabber plugin and click
	  Register on the login window)
	* GtkIMHtml handles themes (no background pixmaps though) (thanks
	  decklin, mishan)
	* URLS Linkify properly in Buddy chats
	* Jabber compiles better on Solaris?
	* Gaim works with Oscar Again (Huge thanks to Adam Fritzler of
	  libfaim)


Rodney's Note:
--------------

Please use TOC this time since oscar is not working with AIM very well.
Use account management and change to TOC.  Be sure to use "http" and 
"ih.proxy.lucent.com" for proxy host and "8000" for proxy port.

Rebuilt as a static binary for the  ilinux platform, as library
incompatibilities were apparently causing it to dump core under RedHat
7.0

OLD NEWS
========
gaim has been installed in exptools for the solaris and ilinux
platforms.  This is an open-source program compatible with AOL Instant
Messenger.  It's also supposedly compatible with several other messaging
protocols such as Jabber, MSN, and napster, but I don't know how to test
any of those.  If anyone knows how to test these other services please
do so and report back to psfales@lucent.com.

I've observed some core dumps with the the Solaris version, but nothing
reproducable.  If you have problems, particularly if you can reliably
reproduce them, report back to psfales@lucent.com.

To get started with aim, you must first register for a "screen name" 
at http://www.aol.com/aim.  Then, start gaim, and click on "Accounts"
to create an account.  Select "Add" and in the box that pops up, select
"Oscar" for the protocol.  Enter your Screenname, and under the "Oscar
Options" tab make sure that the Authorizer is set to "login.oscar.aol.com"
and the Authorizer Port is 88.

At that point you can start entering your "Buddies" and sending
messages.  More documentation is available at http://www.marko.net/gaim/
