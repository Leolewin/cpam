You can use the `diff' command to show differences between two files,
or each corresponding file in two directories. `diff' outputs
differences between files line by line in any of several formats,
selectable by command line options.

You can use the `cmp' command to show the byte and line numbers where
two files differ. `cmp' can also show all the bytes that differ
between the two files, side by side.

You can use the `diff3' command to show differences among three files.
When two people have made independent changes to a common original,
`diff3' can report the differences between the original and the two
changed versions, and can produce a merged file that contains both
persons' changes together with warnings about conflicts.

You can use the `sdiff' command to merge two files interactively.
