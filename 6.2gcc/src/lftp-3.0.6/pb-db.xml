      <description attribution="freshmeat.net">
lftp is a sophisticated command line based FTP client. It has a
multithreaded design allowing you to issue and execute multiple
commands simultaneosly or in the background. It also features
mirroring capabilities and will reconnect and continue transfers in
the event of a disconnection. Also, if you quit the program while
transfers are still in progress, it will switch to nohup mode and
finish the transfers in the background. HTTP protocol and FTP over
HTTP proxy are supported.

Low level stuff supported: ftp proxy, http proxy, ftp over http,
opie/skey, fxp transfers, automatic retrying on non-fatal errors and
timeouts, ipv6, socks.

lftp has shell-like command syntax allowing you to launch several
commands in parallel in background (&amp;). It is also possible to
group commands within () and execute them in background. All
background jobs are executed in the same single process. You can bring
a foreground job to background with ^Z (c-z) and back with command
`wait' (or `fg' which is alias to `wait'). To list running jobs, use
command `jobs'.  Some commands allow redirecting their output (cat,
ls, ...) to file or via pipe to external command. Commands can be
executed conditionally based on termination status of previous command
(&amp;&amp;, ||).
