      <description>
libIDL is a library for creating trees of CORBA Interface Definition
Language (IDL) files, which is a specification for defining portable
interfaces.

With libIDL, you can parse an IDL file which will be automatically run
through the C preprocessor (on systems with one available), and have
detailed error and warning messages displayed. On a compilation
without errors, the tree is returned to the custom application.
libIDL performs compilation phases from lexical analysis to nearly
full semantic analysis with some optimizations, and will attempt to
generate meaningful errors and warnings for invalid or deprecated IDL.

libIDL exports functionality used to generate detailed conforming
error and warning messages in gcc-like format, and also comes with a
default backend to generate IDL into a file or string (useful for
customized messages or comments in the output). The IDL backend is
complete enough that most generated IDL can be reparsed by libIDL
without errors. libIDL returns separate syntax and namespace trees,
and includes functionality to hide syntactical information from the
primary tree, while keeping it accessible through the namespace for
type information and name lookup.

Optional extensions to standard IDL can be enabled using parse flags.
These include node properties, embedded code fragments, and XPIDL.
Nodes can also have declarations tags which assign particular
attributions to certain IDL constructs to further facilitate custom
applications.
