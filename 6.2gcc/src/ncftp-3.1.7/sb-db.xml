we only want IPv4 addresses returned</para></item>
        <item><para>Reversing behavior from 3.1.0 where we did a
shutdown() on the half of the socket that wasn't used. We suspect
this was causing some firewalls and routers to panic and assume the
whole connection was to be closed.</para></item>
        <item><para>Bug fixed where an unresolvable hostname caused a
pointless connection attempt which would fail</para></item>

again</para></item>
        <item><para>Bug fixed with Win32 version of ncftpbookmarks,
which could look in $HOME/.ncftp rather than $HOME/ncftp. Many Win32
users weren't affected, since the HOME environment variable is not
always set.</para></item>

unnecessarily after the file had been sent</para></item>
        <item><para>Bug fixed where passwords were saved if you chose
to autosave bookmarks. NcFTP also makes an effort to avoid saving
passwords in the history and trace files if you foolishly use
passwords on your command lines</para></item>
        <item><para>Bug fixed on Win32 port where putting a file that
did not exist could cause a crash</para></item>
        <item><para>The "-r" (recursive) flag is back for "bgget" and
"bgput". We now spool the directory by creating individual spool
files for each file in the directory, which should increase
reliability and usability of this feature.</para></item>
        <item><para>The binary packages should be a bit leaner, since
ncftpls wasn't getting stripped</para></item>
        <item><para>Library optimizations should result in less
unneeded code included with programs that use the libraries. The
binaries should be smaller as a result.</para></item>
        <item><para>Recursive uploading has been substantially
reworked. "put -R" should now work better, especially on the Win32
port. Arbitrary pathname sizes have also been removed, so directory
trees should only be limited by available memory and stack
space.</para></item>
        <item><para>Huge number of lint fixes. NcFTP now compiles
cleanly on several platforms even with extra warning options
enabled.</para></item>
        <item><para>Large number of internal changes to the configure
scripts</para></item>
        <item><para>Using my cool hack, "ccdv", in Makefiles.
Originally this became a necessity since some platforms could have
$CFLAGS 4 or 5 lines long! Besides streamlining the build process so
that lint warnings can easily be spotted, the builds are pleasing to
the eye with ANSI color if your $TERM supports it.</para></item>
        <item><para>Fixed bug where Win32 $HOME bug fixed for 3.0.4
wasn't fixed for ncftpbookmarks</para></item>
        <item><para>Fixes for large file support for the Win32
port</para></item>
        <item><para>Bugs fixed in Win32 port of
ncftpbatch</para></item>
        <item><para>A few bug fixes for getline</para></item>

include ".sh", since Sun apparently distributes the JDK as a shell
script with binary data appended</para></item>
