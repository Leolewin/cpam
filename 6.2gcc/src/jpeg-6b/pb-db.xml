This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression
and decompression. JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized
compression method for full-color and gray-scale images. JPEG is
intended for compressing "real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons
and other non-realistic images are not its strong suit. JPEG is
lossy, meaning that the output image is not exactly identical to the
input image. Hence you must not use JPEG if you have to have
identical output bits. However, on typical photographic images, very
good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and
remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a
low-quality image. For more details, see the references, or just
experiment with various compression settings.

This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and
progressive compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting
all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter
settings aren't implemented yet. We have made no provision for
supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the
standard.
