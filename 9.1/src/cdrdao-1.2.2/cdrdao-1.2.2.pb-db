      <description>
cdrdao creates audio and data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode driven
by a description file called toc-file. In DAO mode it is possible to
create non standard track pre-gaps that have other lengths than 2
seconds and contain nonzero audio data. This is for example useful to
divide live recordings into tracks where 2 second gaps would be kind
of irritating.
