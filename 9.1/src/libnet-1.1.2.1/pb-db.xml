      <title>libnet network routine library</title>
      <vendor>Mike Schiffman</vendor>

      <description>
The Network Library provides a simple API for commonly used low-level
network functions (mainly packet injection). Using libnet, it is easy
to build and write arbitrary network packets. It provides a portable
framework for low-level network packet writing and handling. Libnet
includes packet creation at the IP layer and at the link layer as well
as a host of supplementary and complementary functionality.
