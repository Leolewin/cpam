      <description>
Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms
which provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple
threads of execution (aka "multithreading") inside event-driven
applications. All threads run in the same address space of the server
application, but each thread has it's own individual program-counter,
run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable.
