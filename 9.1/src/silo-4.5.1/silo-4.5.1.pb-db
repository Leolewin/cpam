Silo is a data format and library developed at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory for storing rectilinear, curvilinear,
unstructured, or point meshes in 2D and 3D. It supports data upon
those meshes, including scalar, vector, and tensor variables; volume
fraction-based materials; and mass fraction-based species. It fully
supports block structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) meshes by way
of mesh blocks structured in a hierarchy. Silo sits on top of other
low-level storage libraries such as PDB, NetCDF, and HDF5.
