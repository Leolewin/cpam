Valgrind is a tool that helps you find memory management problems in
programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all
reads and writes of memory are checked, and calls to
malloc/new/free/delete are intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can
detect problems such as use of uninitialized memory, reading/writing
of memory after it has been freed, reading/writing off the end of
malloced blocks, reading/writing inappropriate areas on the stack,
memory leaks in which pointers to malloced blocks are lost forever,
passing of uninitialized and/or unaddressable memory to system calls,
and mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs. free/delete/delete [].
