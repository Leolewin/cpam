          <item><para>If you had built BIND 9.6 with any of
ALLOW_NSEC3PARAM_UPDATE, ALLOW_SECURE_TO_INSECURE or
ALLOW_INSECURE_TO_SECURE defined, then you should ensure that all
changes that are in progress have completed prior to upgrading to BIND
9.7.  BIND 9.7 implements those features in a way which is not
backwards compatible.</para></item>
          <item><para>Prior releases had a bug which caused HMAC-SHA*
keys with long secrets to be used incorrectly.  Fixing this bug means
that older versions of BIND 9 may fail to interoperate with this
version when using TSIG keys.  If this occurs, the new
"isc-hmac-fixup" tool will convert a key with a long secret into a
form that works correctly with all versions of BIND 9.  See the
"isc-hmac-fixup" man page for additional details.</para></item>
          <item><para>Revoking a DNSSEC key with "dnssec-revoke"
changes its key ID. It is possible for the new key ID to collide with
that of a different key.  Newly generated keys will not have this
problem, as "dnssec-keygen" looks for potential collisions before
generating keys, but exercise caution if using key revokation with
keys that were generated by older versions of BIND 9.  See the
Administrator's Reference Manual, section 4.10 ("Dynamic Trust Anchor
Management") for more details.</para></item>
          <item><para>A bug was fixed in which a key's scheduled
inactivity date was stored incorectly.  Users who participated in the
9.7.0 BETA test and had DNSSEC keys with scheduled inactivity dates
will need to reset those keys' dates using "dnssec-settime
-I".</para></item>
