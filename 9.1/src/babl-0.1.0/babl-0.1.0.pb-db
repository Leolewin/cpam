      <title>BABL Pixel Transform Library</title>
      <vendor>Martin Nordholts</vendor>

      <description>
babl is a dynamic, any to any, pixel format translation library.

It allows converting between different methods of storing pixels known
as pixel formats that have with different bitdepths and other data
representations, color models and component permutations.

A vocabulary to formulate new pixel formats from existing primitives
is provided as well as the framework to add new color models and data
types.
