      <title>Less Pager</title>
      <vendor>Mark Nudelman</vendor>

      <description>
Less is a program similar to more, i.e. a terminal based program for
viewing text files and the output from other programs. Less offers
many features beyond those that more does:
  * _Backwards movement_
    It's hard to believe some people are still using pagers that don't
    let you move backwards in the file. Even pagers that do let you
    move backwards often don't work when viewing "standard input";
    that is, data that is being piped into the pager from another
    program. 

  * _Searching and highlighting_
    Less lets you search for text in the file you're viewing. You can
    search forwards and backwards. Furthermore, less highlights the
    text that matches your search, to make it easy to see where the
    match is. 

  * _Multiple files_
    Less allows you to switch between any number of different files,
    remembering your position in each file. You can also do a single
    sear_ch which spans all the files you are working with. 

  * _Bold and underline_
    Some text files, notably Unix-style "man pages", use overstriking
    (backspaces) to simulate underlined and bold text. Less interprets
    this overstriking and displays the text in real underlined or bold
    mode. 

  * _Advanced features_
    Less has a large number of fancy features for advanced users. Once
    you learn the basics, you'll find you can customize less to do
    almost anything you want it to do. You can change key bindings,
    set different tab stops, set up filters to view compressed data or
    other file types, customize the prompt, display line numbers, use
    "tag" files, and more.
