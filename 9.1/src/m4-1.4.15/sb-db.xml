        <item><para>The command line option '--debugfile', introduced in
1.4.7, now treats its argument as optional, in order to allow setting
the debug output back to stderr when used without an argument; and order
is now significant with respect to command line files.  You must
therefore use 'm4 --debugfile=trace file', not 'm4 file --debugfile
trace'.  This change does not affect the deprecated
'-o'/'--error-output' option.</para></item>

      <change from="1.4.11" to="1.4.12">
        <item><para>Fix regression introduced in 1.4.4b where using
"traceon" could delete a macro. This was most noticeable with
"traceon('traceon')", but would also happen in cases such as
"foo(traceon('foo'))".</para></item>

died with an assertion failure.</para></item>

died with an assertion failure on a traced but undefined
macro.</para></item>
        <item><para>New "-g"/"--gnu" command-line option overrides
"-G"/"--traditional". For now, the environment variable
POSIXLY_CORRECT has no effect on M4 behavior; but a future release of
M4 will behave as though --traditional is implied if POSIXLY_CORRECT
is set (this future change is necessary, because in the current
release, there is no way to disable GNU extensions that conflict with
POSIX without the use of a non-POSIX command-line argument). Clients
of M4 that want to use GNU extensions, even when POSIXLY_CORRECT is
set, should start using the -g command-line argument, even though it
is currently a no-op if -G did not appear earlier in the command line,
so that the client will not break in the face of an upgraded m4 and a
POSIXLY_CORRECT execution environment.</para></item>
        <item><para>The "-L"/"--nesting-limit" command-line option now
defaults to 0 for unlimited on platforms that can detect and deal with
stack overflow. On systems that lack alternate stack support, such as
Cygwin, and on systems that do not obey the POSIX semantics for
distinguishing stack overflow from other exceptions, such as Linux,
you can optionally install the libsigsegv library (version 2.6 or
newer recommended) to enhance m4's ability to accurately report stack
overflow: http://www.gnu.org/software/libsigsegv/</para></item>
        <item><para>A number of portability improvements inherited
from gnulib.</para></item>
      </change>

      <change from="1.4.10" to="1.4.11">
        <item><para>Security fixes for the -F option, for bugs present
since -F was introduced in 1.3: Avoid core dump with 'm4 -F file -t
undefined', and avoid arbitrary code execution with certain file
names.</para></item>
        <item><para>Fix regression introduced in 1.4.9b in the
"divert" builtin when more than 512 kibibytes are saved in diversions
on platforms like NetBSD or darwin where fopen(name,"a+") seeks to the
end of the file.</para></item>
        <item><para>The output of the "maketemp" and "mkstemp"
builtins is now quoted if a file was created. This is a minor security
fix, because it was possible (although rather unlikely) that an
unquoted string could match an existing macro name, such that use of
the "mkstemp" output would trigger inadvertent macro expansion and
operate on the wrong file name.</para></item>
        <item><para>Enhance the "defn" builtin to support
concatenation of multiple text arguments, as required by POSIX.
However, at this time, it is not possible to concatenate a builtin
macro with anything else; a warning is now issued if this is
attempted, although a future version of M4 may lift this restriction
to match other implementations.</para></item>
        <item><para>Enhance the "format" builtin to parse all C99
floating point numbers, even on platforms where strtod(3) is buggy,
although the replacement function does have the known issue of
rounding errors when parsing some decimal floating point values. This
fixes testsuite failures introduced in 1.4.9b.</para></item>
        <item><para>Enhance the "index" builtin to guarantee linear
behavior, in spite of the surprisingly large number of systems with a
brain-dead quadratic strstr(3)</para></item>
        <item><para>A number of portability improvements inherited
from gnulib</para></item>

        <item><para>Upgrade from GPL version 2 to GPL version 3 or
later</para></item>
        <item><para>A number of portability improvements inherited
from gnulib</para></item>
        <item><para>Avoid undefined behavior introduced in 1.4.9b in
the "format" builtin when handling %c. However, this area of code has
never been documented, and currently does not match the POSIX behavior
of printf(1), so it may have further changes in the next
version.</para></item>
      </change>

      <change from="1.4.9" to="1.4.9c">
        <item><para>Fix regression introduced in 1.4.9 in the "eval"
builtin when performing division</para></item>
        <item><para>Fix regression introduced in 1.4.8 in the "-F"
option that made it impossible to freeze more than 512 kibibytes of
diverted text.</para></item>
        <item><para>The synclines option "-s" no longer generates sync
lines in the middle of multiline comments or quoted
strings.</para></item>
        <item><para>Work around a number of corner-case POSIX
compliance bugs in various broken stdio libraries. In particular, the
"syscmd" builtin behaves more predictably when stdin is
seekable.</para></item>
        <item><para>The "format" builtin now understands formats such
as %a, %A, and %'hhd, and works around a number of platform printf
bugs. Furthermore, the sequence format(%*.*d,-1,-1,1) no longer
outputs random data. However, some non-compliant platforms such as
mingw still have known bugs in strtod that may cause testsuite
failures.</para></item>
        <item><para>The testsuite is improved to also run gnulib
portability tests for the features that M4 imports from
gnulib.</para></item>
      </change>

      <change from="1.4.8" to="1.4.9">
        <item><para>Minor documentation and portability
cleanups</para></item>
        <item><para>Fix a regression introduced in 1.4.8 that made m4
unable to process files larger than 2GiB on some
platforms.</para></item>
        <item><para>Fix a regression introduced in 1.4.8 that made m4
dump core when invoked as 'm4 -- file'.</para></item>
        <item><para>The "eval" builtin now follows C precedence rules.
Additionally, the short-circuit operators correctly short-circuit
division by zero. The previously undocumented alias of '=' meaning
'==' in eval now triggers a deprecation warning, so that a future
version of M4 can implement a form of variable assignment as an
extension.</para></item>
        <item><para>The "include" builtin now affects exit status on
failure, as required by POSIX. Use "sinclude" if you need a successful
exit status.</para></item>
        <item><para>The "-E"/"--fatal-warnings" command-line option
now has two levels. When specified only once, warnings affect exit
status, but execution continues, so that you can see all warnings
instead of fixing them one at a time. To achieve 1.4.8 behavior, where
the first warning immediately exits, specify -E twice on the command
line.</para></item>
        <item><para>A new "--warn-macro-sequence" command-line option
allows detection of sequences in "define" and "pushdef" definitions
that match an optional regular expression. The default regular
expression is "<command>\$\({[^}]*}\|[0-9][0-9]+\)</command>",
corresponding to the sequences that might not behave correctly when
upgrading to the eventual M4 2.0. By default, M4 2.0 will follow the
POSIX requirement that a macro definition containing
"<command>$11</command>" must expand to the first argument
concatenated with 1, rather than the eleventh argument; and will take
advantage of the POSIX wording that allows implementations to treat
"<command>${11}</command>" as the eleventh argument instead of literal
text. Be aware that Autoconf 2.61 will not work with this option
enabled with the default regular expression; but Autoconf 2.62 will be
compatible with this option.</para></item>
        <item><para>Improved portability to platforms such as BSD/OS
and AIX.</para></item>
      </change>

      <change from="1.4.7" to="1.4.8">
        <item><para>The '<command>divert</command>' macro and
'<command>-H</command>'/'<command>--hashsize</command>' command line
option no longer cause a core dump when handed extra large values.
Also, '<command>divert</command>' now uses memory proportional to the
number of diversions in use, rather than to the maximum diversion
number encountered, so that large diversion numbers are less likely to
exhaust system memory; and is no longer limited by the maximum number
of file descriptors.</para></item>
        <item><para>The '<command>--help</command>' and
'<command>--version</command>' command line options now consistently
override all earlier options. For example, 'm4 --debugfile=trace
--help' now no longer accidentally creates an empty file
'<command>trace</command>'.</para></item>
        <item><para>The
'<command>-L</command>'/'<command>--nesting-limit</command>' command
line option can now be set to 0 to remove the default limit of 1024.
However, it is still possible that heavily nested input can cause
abrupt program termination due to stack overflow.</para></item>
        <item><para>Problems encountered when writing to standard
error, such as with the '<command>errprint</command>' macro, now
always cause a non-zero exit status.</para></item>
        <item><para>Warnings and errors issued during macro expansion
are now consistently reported at the line where the macro name was
detected, rather than where the close parenthesis resides. Text
wrapped by '<command>m4wrap</command>' now remembers the location that
was in effect when m4wrap was invoked, rather than changing to line 0
and the empty string for a file. The macros
'<command>__line__</command>' and '<command>__file__</command>' now
work correctly even as the last token in an included
file.</para></item>
        <item><para>The '<command>builtin</command>' and
'<command>indir</command>' macros now transparently handle builtin
tokens generated by '<command>defn</command>'.</para></item>
        <item><para>When diversions created by the
'<command>divert</command>' macro collect enough text that M4 must use
temporary files, the environment variable $TMPDIR is now consulted,
and a better effort is made to clean up those files in the event of a
fatal signal.</para></item>
        <item><para>The '<command>mkstemp</command>' builtin is added
with the same GNU semantics as '<command>maketemp</command>', based on
the recommendation of POSIX to deprecate the POSIX semantics of
'<command>maketemp</command>' as inherently insecure. In GNU mode (no
-G supplied on the command line), '<command>maketemp</command>'
silently retains the secure GNU semantics, but a future release of M4
will change this to emit a warning. In traditional mode (m4 -G),
'<command>maketemp</command>' now uses the POSIX-mandated insecure
semantics, and issues a warning that you should convert your script to
use '<command>mkstemp</command>' instead. Additionally,
'<command>mkstemp</command>' and '<command>maketemp</command>' are now
well-defined even if the template argument does not end in six
'<command>X</command>' characters.</para></item>
        <item><para>The manual has been improved, including a new
section on a composite macro
'<command>foreach</command>'.</para></item>
        <item><para>The '<command>changecom</command>' and
'<command>changequote</command>' macros now treat an empty second
argument the same as if it were missing, rather than using the empty
string and making it impossible to end a comment or
quote.</para></item>
        <item><para>The '<command>translit</command>' macro now
operates in linear instead of quadratic time, and is now eight-bit
clean.</para></item>
        <item><para>The '<command>-D</command>',
'<command>-U</command>', '<command>-s</command>', and
'<command>-t</command>' command line options now take effect after any
files encountered earlier on the command line, rather than up front,
as is done in traditional implementations and required by
POSIX.</para></item>
      </change>

      <change from="1.4.6" to="1.4.7">
        <item><para>Fix regression from 1.4.5 in handling a file that
ends in a macro expansion without arguments instead of a
newline.</para></item>
        <item><para>The define and pushdef macros now warn when the
first argument is not a string, rather than silently doing
nothing.</para></item>
        <item><para>Standard input can now be read more than once, as
in 'm4 - file -', and is not closed until all wrapped text is handled.
This makes a difference when stdin is not a regular file, and also
fixes bugs when using the syscmd or esyscmd macros from wrapped
text.</para></item>
        <item><para>When standard input is a seekable file, the
m4exit, syscmd, and esyscmd macros now restore the current position to
the next unread byte rather than discarding an arbitrary amount of
buffered data.</para></item>
        <item><para>SysV command-line compatibility is no longer a
goal of GNU M4; the focus will be instead on POSIX compatibility. This
release continues to support previous usage, but adds warnings in
areas which will allow a future version of GNU M4 to use its own
extensions without being tied to the SysV command line
interface.</para></item>
        <item><para>The no-op compatibility command line options -B,
-N, -S, -T, and --diversions may be withdrawn or assigned new meanings
in future releases, so they now issue a warning if used.</para></item>
        <item><para>A new command line option -i replaces the
compatibility -e as the short spelling of --interactive, for
consistency with other GNU tools; a warning is issued if the old
spelling is used, and it may be assigned new meaning in future
releases.</para></item>
        <item><para>A new command line option --debugfile replaces the
options -o and --error-output as the preferred spelling. The old
options were misleading in their names and inconsistent with other GNU
tools; they are still silently accepted, but no longer documented in
--help, and may be assigned new meanings in future
releases.</para></item>

      <change from="1.4.5" to="1.4.6">
        <item><para>Fix buffer overruns in regexp and patsubst macros
when handed a trailing backslash in the replacement text, or when

the debugfile macro. In particular, the syscmd and esyscmd macros can
no longer interfere with the debug stream or diversions.</para></item>
        <item><para>The m4exit macro now converts values outside the
range 0-255 to 1.</para></item>
        <item><para>It is now an error if a command-line input file
ends in the middle of a comment, matching the behavior of mid-string

        <item><para>The dnl macro now warns if end of file is
encountered instead of a newline.</para></item>
        <item><para>The error message when end of file is encountered

rather than '<command>NONE:0:</command>'.</para></item>
        <item><para>The debugmode and __file__ macros, and the
-s/--synclines option, now show what directory a file was found in
when the -I/--include option or M4PATH variable had an
effect.</para></item>
        <item><para>The changequote and changecom macros now work with
8-bit characters, and quotes and comments that begin with
'<command>(</command>' are properly recognized following a
word.</para></item>
        <item><para>The new macro __program__ is added, which allows
the input file to issue an error message that resembles messages from
m4. Warning and error messages have been reformatted to comply with
GNU Coding Standards.</para></item>

recognized only with arguments.</para></item>

        <item><para>Fix sysval on BeOS, OS/2, and other systems that
store exit status in the low-order byte. Additionally, on Unix
platforms, if syscmd was terminated by a signal, sysval now displays
the signal number shifted left by eight bits, to match traditional m4
implementations.</para></item>
        <item><para>The maketemp macro is no longer subject to
platform limitations (such as 26 or 32 max files from a given
template).</para></item>
        <item><para>Frozen files now require that the first directive
be V (version), to better diagnose version mismatch. Additionally, if
the F directive (builtin function) names an unknown builtin that
existed in the m4 that froze the file but not in the current m4 (for
example, changeword), the warning is deferred until an attempt is made
to actually use the builtin. This allows downgrading from beta m4-1.4o
to stable m4-1.4.5 without breaking autoconf.</para></item>

truncates trailing zeroes on integers printed with %.0f. On systems
without these functions, format is no longer subject to a buffer
overflow that permitted arbitrary code execution.</para></item>
        <item><para>On native Windows builds, the macro __windows__ is
provided instead of __unix__. Likewise, on OS/2 builds, the macro
__os2__ is provided. This allows input files to determine when syscmd

the macro is subsequently undefined or redefined. The traceon and
traceoff macros no longer warn about undefined symbols. This solves a
crash when using indir on an undefined macro traced with the -t
option, as well as an incorrect result of ifdef. Furthermore, tracing
is no longer transferred with builtins, solving the bug of
"<command>m4 -tm4_eval</command>" failing to give trace output on the
input
