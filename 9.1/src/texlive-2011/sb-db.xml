the FreeType Project.</para>

The license affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test
programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.</para>
        <para>This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG
(Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and
use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a
consequence, its main points are that:</para>

          <item><para>We don't promise that this software works.
However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is'
distribution)</para></item>

in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free'
usage)</para></item>

acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the

originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm,

beta or final release.</para>
          <para>`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the

`executable'. This program is referred to as `a program using the
FreeType engine'.</para>
          <para>This license applies to all files distributed in the

you must contact us to verify this.</para>

          <para>Commercial distributors of software may accept
certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners
and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
"Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor
must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such
claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.</para>
          <para>For example, a Contributor might include the
Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor
is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then
makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X,
those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial
Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors
related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</para></item>

may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
