      <description>
UUDeview is a smart decoder for attachments that you have received in
encoded form via electronic mail or from the usenet. It is similar to
the standard uudecode(1) command, yet with more comfort and
flexibility. UUDeview supports the uuencoding, xxencoding, Base64 and
BinHex encoding methods, and is able to handle split-files (which have
been sent in multiple parts) as well as multiple files at once, thus
greatly simplifying the decoding process.
