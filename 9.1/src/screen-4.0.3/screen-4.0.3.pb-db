      <description>
Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical
terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells. Each
virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal and,
in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429)
and ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete line and support for
multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for
each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows the
user to move text regions between windows. When screen is called, it
creates a single window with a shell in it (or the specified command)
and then gets out of your way so that you can use the program as you
normally would. Then, at any time, you can create new (full-screen)
windows with other programs in them (including more shells), kill the
current window, view a list of the active windows, turn output logging
on and off, copy text between windows, view the scrollback history,
switch between windows, etc. All windows run their programs completely
independent of each other. Programs continue to run when their window
is currently not visible and even when the whole screen session is
detached from the users terminal.
